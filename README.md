## Abstract:
    This project aims to develop a personalized course recommendation engine integrated with a Django web application, leveraging machine
    learning techniques. Utilizing a dataset from Udemy containing course information, the system analyzes user preferences and behaviors
    to provide tailored recommendations. The recommendation engine employs machine learning algorithms to predict courses that align with 
    the user's interests based on input provided. The output of the Django web application includes recommended course names, links to 
    courses, prices, and the number of students enrolled. This project demonstrates the significance of recommendation engines in enhancing
    user experience, increasing engagement, and driving revenue growth in the competitive digital landscape.

## Objective :
    Build A course recommendation engine of Udemy course dataset using machine learning and integrate it with Django application.
## Dataset :
    * The dataset contains information on 3678 courses available on Udemy, spanning various subjects and levels of difficulty. Here's a 
      description of the columns:
        * course_id: Unique identifier for each course.
        * course_title: Title of the course.
        * url: URL of the course.
        * is_paid: Boolean indicating whether the course is paid or not.
        * price: Price of the course.
        * num_subscribers: Number of subscribers enrolled in the course.
        * num_reviews: Number of reviews for the course.
        * num_lectures: Number of lectures in the course.
        * level: Difficulty level of the course (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
        * content_duration: Duration of the course content.
        * published_timestamp: Timestamp indicating when the course was published.
        * subject: Subject category of the course.
    * This dataset provides comprehensive information about Udemy courses, including their popularity (measured by the number of subscribers and reviews),
    pricing, content duration, and level of difficulty. It covers a wide range of subjects, making it suitable for building a recommendation engine to suggest
    courses based on user preferences and interests.
## Project Overview:
    * Data Collection and Preparation:
        * Gather the Udemy course dataset containing relevant information such as course titles, URLs, prices, subscriber counts, and more.
        * Perform data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, and converting data types if necessary.
        * Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of course attributes and identify any patterns or trends.
        * Select and implement appropriate machine learning algorithms for course recommendation, considering factors such as scalability, accuracy, and interpretability.
    * Integration with Django Web Application:
        * Set up a Django project to serve as the framework for the course recommendation system.
        * Implement backend functionality within the Django application to handle user queries and communicate with the recommendation model.
